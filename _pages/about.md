I am a Master of Science student in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as of Fall 2024. My interests are at the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction and AI in education. I am a part of the [Computing Education Research Area](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/research/areas/computers-and-education) at UIUC, and my advisor is [Mariana Silva](https://mfsilva22.github.io/).

My current research interests center on enhancing learning experiences in introductory CS courses for engineering students. I am exploring the integration of LLMs to generate erroneous programming examples in CS1 context. In addition, I am designing learner-centered educational tools to support undergraduate conversational programmers.

I am the cofounder of [AristAI](https://aristai.io/), an AI Teaching Assistant designed to assist course instructors by accurately and promptly answering student questions and efficiently managing student queries on their behalf.

In my spare time, I enjoy bouldering, playing table tennis, listening to music, hanging out with friends, or just sleeping. Iâ€™m a huge fan of Coldplay, Avicii, and Kygo.
